## 📂 Research Oriented Projects

🧩 With [`Braico`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [`Filo`](https://github.com/filobayesian), we explored **ARC–AGI with Reinforcement Learning**:
- [`ARC (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.
- [`ARC (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.

🧠 Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on:
- **RL World Models**: Benchmarking JEPA+VICReg vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.

🎲 [`Markets Probability Bias`](https://github.com/filobayesian/cognitive-poly): Studying cognitive distortions in prediction market probabilities.
