## 📂 Research Oriented Projects


🧩 With [`Braico`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [`Filo`](https://github.com/filobayesian) we explored **ARC–AGI with Reinforcement Learning**:
- [`ARC (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.
- [`ARC (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.
- [`ARC (v3)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC3): World modeling.

🧠 Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on:
- ['RL World Models'](https://github.com/bocconi-narcos/latent-world-models): Benchmarking LeJEPA+VICReg vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.

## 📫 Personal Projects
- 🚀 ['Codex Hackaton'](https://github.com/manfredi31/codex-hackathon): I was invited at the 2026 Codex Hackaton, didn't win but built a pretty cool game ai studio.
- 🌤 [`Weather Derivatives`](https://github.com/GianiRanzetti/Minerva---Weather-Derivatives): Climate modeling with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes using Wavelet Networks.
