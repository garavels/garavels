## 📂 Research Oriented Projects

🧩 With [`Braico`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [`Filo`](https://github.com/filobayesian) we explored **ARC–AGI with Reinforcement Learning**:
- [`ARC (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.
- [`ARC (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.
- [`ARC (v3)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC3): World modeling.

🧠 Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on:
- ['RL World Models'](https://github.com/bocconi-narcos/latent-world-models): Benchmarking JEPA+VICReg vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.

## 🌐 University Projects
📊 [`Statistics-30457`](https://github.com/garavels/Statistics-30457): Vanilla risk parity vs. alternative model portfolios.
📈 [`Econometrics-30462`](https://github.com/filobayesian/Econometrics-30462): Demand modeling using cross-sectional and panel techniques.


## 📫 Personal Projects
🌤 [`Weather Derivatives`](https://github.com/GianiRanzetti/Minerva---Weather-Derivatives): Climate modeling with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes using Wavelet Networks.
