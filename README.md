## 🔍 About Me
- currently studying Econ @ Bocconi in Milan
- part of [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association)
- interested in Extreme Value Theory
- deepening understanding of Prediction Markets

## 📂 Research Oriented Projects
🧩 With [Braico](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [Filo](https://github.com/filobayesian) we explored ARC-AGI with Reinforcement Learning:
[ARC (v1)](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.
[ARC (v2)](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.
🧩 Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on
RL World Models: Benchmarking JEPA+VICReg vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.
🧩 Probability distorsion in betting markets
